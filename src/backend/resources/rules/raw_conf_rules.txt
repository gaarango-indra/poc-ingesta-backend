Instructions

RULE 1: Conditional Replacement Rule in the Template:

Rule 1.1: Only replace text within {example} placeholders if it meets the following conditions:

Rule 1.1.1: No question mark ? inside the braces: If the text within braces contains ?, as in {?example}, do not replace it.
Rule 1.1.1: No $ symbol before the braces: If the text within braces has a $ symbol before it, as in ${example}, do not replace it.

Examples:

Allow replacement: {example}, /{example}
Do not replace: {?example}, ${example}

RULE 2: Data Transformation in HOCON based on the Value of partition:

Rule 2.1: If the partition value is "cutoff_date", the transformations block must follow this structure:

transformations=[
    {
        default=${?YEAR}"-"${?MONTH}"-"${?DAY}
        defaultType=string
        field="cutoff_date"
        type=literal
    }
]
Rule 2.2: If the partition value is "partition_data_year_id, partition_data_month_id, partition_data_day_id", the transformations block must follow this structure:

transformations=[
    {
        default=${?YEAR}
        defaultType=string
        field="partition_data_year_id"
        type=literal
    },
    {
        default=${?MONTH}
        defaultType=string
        field="partition_data_month_id"
        type=literal
    },
    {
        default=${?DAY}
        defaultType=string
        field="partition_data_day_id"
        type=literal
    }
]

RULE 3: Strict Template Completion Rule

When responding, strictly adhere to the provided template structure. Replacements must be performed for parameters that meet the criteria outlined in Rule 1, while leaving non-replaceable parameters intact as specified. Ensure the response maintains the format and structure of the template but allows dynamic replacements where applicable.

Notes for the Agent:
Ensure the HOCON structures and replacements are applied exactly as described in these rules.
If you encounter a partition value not mentioned above, check before proceeding.
